## A. Preparation

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

1. A `.bacpac` file â€“ this is a backup file of a database.

2. SQL Server is running on your computer (locally) or on a server you can access.

   - Example: `localhost` or `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB`

3. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) version 18.x or newer is installed.

## D. Additional Notes

- **Error: "Could not import package"**  
  - Your SQL Server version must be the same or newer than the one used to create the `.bacpac` file.

- **File Access Error**  
  - Run SSMS as Administrator.

- **Invalid File Path**  
  - Make sure SQL Server has permission to write to the folder where it stores database files.

  - Check if the user has permission to access the new database.
