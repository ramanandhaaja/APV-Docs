# Web Application Structure

This document provides a detailed structure of the AVP Web Application, based on the actual source code at `/assetvaluerpro-avp/API/Web/`.

## Overview

This document explains the folder structure of the web application, located at `API/Web`. Understanding this structure helps you navigate, develop, and maintain the project efficiently.

## Top-Level Structure

- `.env`, `.env.prod`, `.env.test`: Environment variable files for development, production, and testing.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore in Git.
- `README.md`: Project overview, setup, and usage instructions.
- `dist/`: Output folder for the production build (auto-generated).
- `index.html`: Main HTML entry point for the app.
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`: Dependency management and lock files.
- `postcss.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`: Configuration for PostCSS and Tailwind CSS frameworks.
- `public/`: Static assets and files served directly.
- `site/`: Site-specific assets or configuration (custom usage).
- `src/`: Main application source code (see details below).
- `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`: TypeScript configuration files.
- `vite-env.d.ts`, `vite.config.mjs`: Vite environment types and configuration.

## `src/` Directory

The `src/` folder contains all main application source code:

- `App.tsx`: Root React component, the main entry point for the app UI.
- `components/`: Reusable UI components (buttons, forms, widgets, etc.).
- `contexts/`: React context providers for global state management.
- `data/`: Static data, mock data, or seed data used by the app.
- `fonts/`: Custom font files used throughout the application.
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for encapsulating logic.
- `icons/`: SVG or other icon assets.
- `images/`: Image assets used in the UI.
- `models/`: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces for data models.
- `pages/`: Page-level React components, each representing a route in the app.
- `styles/`: Global and modular CSS or SCSS files.
- `configuration.ts`: Application configuration settings.
- `Helper.tsx`, `Format.tsx`: Utility/helper components and formatting functions.
- `index.tsx`: Entry point for rendering the React app.
- `reportWebVitals.js`: Performance measurement setup.
- `serviceWorker.ts`: Service worker registration for offline support.
- `setupTests.ts`: Test environment setup.

## `public/` Directory

- `OidcServiceWorker.js`, `OidcTrustedDomains.js`: Scripts for OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication and trusted domains.
- `favicon.ico`, `logo192.png`, `logo512.png`: Application icons for various devices.
- `manifest.json`: Progressive Web App (PWA) manifest file.
- `robots.txt`: Search engine crawling directives.

## Key Files
- `App.tsx`: Main React application component
- `index.tsx`: Main entry point for React app
- `reportWebVitals.js`: Performance measurement

## Root-Level Configs
- `.env`, `.env.prod`, `.env.test`: Environment configs
- `yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`: Dependency lock files

## Tips

- Only modify files in `dist/` if you know what you're doingâ€”this folder is auto-generated by the build process.
- Add new reusable UI elements to `components/` and new pages to `pages/`.
- Store shared logic in `hooks/` and shared state/context in `contexts/`.
