# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived documentation files that are no longer needed in the main documentation structure. These files were used during the documentation and emoji enhancement processes and are kept here for historical reference only.

## Contents

1. `Documentation_Progress.md` - Deprecated progress tracker
2. `Emoji_Implementation_Progress.md` - Completed emoji enhancement tracker
3. `Emoji_Implementation_Plan.md` - The original emoji implementation plan
4. `Next_Steps.md` - Documentation planning steps (all completed)
5. `APV_Documentation_Progress.md` - Main progress tracker (all tasks complete)

## Purpose

These files are kept for historical reference and to maintain a record of the documentation process. They should not be needed for ongoing development or onboarding of new team members.

## Current Documentation

The current, active documentation for the Asset Valuer Pro system is located in the `/home/ubnt/GitHub/APV/working-folder/technical-docs/` directory. Please refer to the `Documentation_Index.md` file in that directory for a comprehensive guide to the available documentation.
