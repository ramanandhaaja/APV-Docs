# [COMPLETED] Next Steps for Asset Valuer Pro Documentation

> **Note**: All tasks in this document have been completed. This document is retained for historical reference. For current documentation status, please refer to `${REPO_ROOT}/working-folder/APV_Documentation_Progress.md`.

## What We've Done So Far

1. **Analyzed Existing Documentation**
   - Reviewed Paul's documentation in `legacy-docs/`
   - Identified key technical information from `Installation.md` and `WebApplication Overview.md`
   - Analyzed database structure from `Database OverView.md`

2. **Created Documentation Structure**
   - Set up directory structure for technical documentation
   - Created README.md with overview of documentation approach
   - Created sample "Quick Documentation" files for key components:
     - API: ImportController.md
     - Models: Asset.md
     - Services: JobOperation.md
     - Reports: AssetLevelReport.md

3. **Identified Technology Stack**
   - Backend: .NET 6 with DevExpress XAF (eXpressApp Framework) version 18.2.5
   - Frontend: JavaScript/Node.js
   - Database: SQL Server on Azure
   - ORM: XPO (eXpress Persistent Objects)
   - CI/CD: Azure DevOps

## Next Steps (Once source code is Available)

1. **Explore Repository Structure**
   - Identify the main solution file
   - Map the repository structure to the solution structure described in the documentation
   - Identify key directories for controllers, models, services, and reports

2. **Identify Key Components**
   - List all API controllers
   - List all data models
   - List all business logic services
   - List all report generators

3. **Create "Quick Documentation" Files**
   - For each identified component, create a documentation file using the appropriate template
   - Focus on filling out the "QUICK DOCUMENTATION" section only
   - Use the sample files as a guide

4. **Link Business Context**
   - Cross-reference the technical components with the business processes described in Paul's documentation
   - Add notes about which business processes each component supports

5. **Prepare for Handoff**
   - Organize all documentation files
   - Create an index or table of contents
   - Prepare a presentation or guide for the new development team

## Prioritization

When creating the "Quick Documentation" files, prioritize components in this order:

1. **Core Data Models**
   - Asset
   - Job
   - ValuationProfile
   - Component

2. **Key Business Logic Services**
   - JobOperation
   - ValuationCalculation
   - ImportExport

3. **Main API Controllers**
   - Those handling job management
   - Those handling asset management
   - Those handling import/export

4. **Report Generators**
   - Focus on the most commonly used reports first

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Rapid Technical Triage)**: 1-2 days after Bitbucket access
- **Phase 2 (Link Business Context)**: 1 day
- **Phase 3 (Handoff Preparation)**: 1 day

## Resources Needed

- Read access to source code repository
