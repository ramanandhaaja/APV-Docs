## Next Steps for Gap Resolution

1. Schedule focused review sessions with the business unit to address:
   - Process ownership and responsibilities
   - Decision criteria and approval workflows
   - Performance metrics and success criteria

2. Arrange technical workshops to clarify:
   - Technical implementation of business rules
   - Integration architecture
   - Data model alignment with business concepts

3. Document responses and update process documentation accordingly

4. Create a feedback loop for ongoing refinement of process documentation
