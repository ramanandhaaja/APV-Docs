# Business Process Documentation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for documenting Asset Valuer Pro (AVP) business processes based on existing documentation, without requiring immediate business unit input. Our approach is to document what we currently know and clearly identify information gaps for future business unit validation.

## Documentation Approach

- **Confidence Indicators**:
  - ðŸŸ¢ High confidence (Clearly documented in existing materials)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Medium confidence (Implied or partially documented, needs verification)
  - ðŸ”´ Low confidence (Gap - requires business unit input)

- **Template Modification**: 
  Using the existing business process template with added confidence indicators

## Core Business Processes to Document

| Process | Priority | Status | Document Location |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Asset Valuation Process (End-to-End) | 1 | ðŸŸ¢ Completed | `/business-docs/processes/Asset_Valuation_Process.md` |
| File Setup and Configuration | 2 | ðŸŸ¢ Completed | `/business-docs/processes/File_Setup_Process.md` | 
| Data Collection | 3 | ðŸŸ¢ Completed | `/business-docs/processes/Data_Collection_Process.md` |
| Calculation and Reporting | 4 | ðŸŸ¢ Completed | `/business-docs/processes/Calculation_Reporting_Process.md` |
| Post-Valuation Processes | 5 | ðŸŸ¢ Completed | `/business-docs/processes/Post_Valuation_Process.md` |

## Supporting Documentation

| Document | Priority | Status | Document Location |
|----------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Business Process Map | 6 | ðŸŸ¢ Completed | `/business-docs/Business_Process_Map.md` |
| Business-Technical Component Mapping | 7 | ðŸŸ¢ Completed | `/business-docs/Business_Technical_Component_Map.md` |
| Information Gaps Summary | 8 | ðŸŸ¢ Completed | `/business-docs/Information_Gaps_Summary.md` |

## Action Plan

1. ~~**Phase 1**: Document core processes using existing information~~ âœ…
   - Target: Complete all core processes with confidence indicators
   - Timeline: Completed on 2025-04-23

2. ~~**Phase 2**: Create business process map showing relationships~~ âœ…
   - Target: Visual representation of how processes interact
   - Timeline: Completed on 2025-04-23

3. ~~**Phase 3**: Create information gaps summary for business unit review~~ âœ…
   - Target: Consolidated list of questions requiring business input
   - Timeline: Completed on 2025-04-23

4. **Phase 4**: Schedule business unit reviews
   - Target: Validate documentation and fill information gaps
   - Timeline: To be scheduled

## Information Sources

Primary sources of information for business process documentation:

1. Overview.pdf - Contains high-level business process information
2. APV Technical Assessment and Documentation Strategy.pdf - Contains technical context
3. Source code analysis - For inferring business rules and process implementation

## Next Steps

1. Prepare for business unit validation sessions:
   - Create presentation summarizing the documented processes
   - Highlight key information gaps requiring validation
   - Develop a structured interview guide for each process

2. Schedule and conduct business unit review sessions:
   - Individual sessions for each core process
   - Combined session for cross-process relationships
   - Technical review of component mappings

3. Update documentation based on business unit feedback:
   - Incorporate validated information
   - Update confidence indicators
   - Add examples and edge cases

4. Develop final business process documentation package:
   - Executive summary
   - Comprehensive process documentation
   - Technical implementation mapping
