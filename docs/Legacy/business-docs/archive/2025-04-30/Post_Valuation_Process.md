### Process Overview
The Post-Valuation Process handles the final stages of the valuation workflow after calculations are complete and results have been accepted by the client. This includes changing job status appropriately, supporting the audit process, archiving the job once financial statements are signed off, and ensuring data is properly recorded for future reference and comparison.
