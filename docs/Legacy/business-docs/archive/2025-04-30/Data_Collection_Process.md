## DETAILED DOCUMENTATION (Complete after all quick sections are done)

### Process Overview
The Data Collection Process involves gathering, validating, and importing all necessary data required to perform valuations in Asset Valuer Pro. This includes importing existing asset data from client systems, collecting additional information through field inspections using the mobile data capture app, and ensuring all required data points are available for the valuation calculations. The process ensures data completeness and accuracy before valuations are calculated. 游릭
