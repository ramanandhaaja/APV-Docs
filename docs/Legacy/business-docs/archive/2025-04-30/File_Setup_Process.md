## DETAILED DOCUMENTATION (Complete after all quick sections are done)

### Process Overview
The File Setup and Configuration Process establishes the foundation for performing valuations in Asset Valuer Pro. It involves creating the client record, configuring users and roles, establishing the valuation framework with appropriate asset hierarchies, and setting up the specific valuation job. This process defines the structure and parameters that govern all subsequent valuation activities. 游릭

### Process Inputs 游리

   - **Inputs Required**: Asset types and classifications 游릭
   - **Outputs Produced**: Structured asset hierarchy 游릭
   - **Decision Points**: 游릭
     - Defining Asset Classes
     - Defining Asset Types
     - Defining Asset Sub-Types
     - Defining Component Types
     - Defining Component Sub-Types

5. **Configure Assumptions**
   - **Role Responsible**: Valuer/Valuation Specialist 游리
   - **Systems Used**: Asset Valuer Pro 游릭
   - **Inputs Required**: Valuation parameters 游릭
   - **Outputs Produced**: Configured assumption tables 游릭
   - **Decision Points**: 游릭
     - Entity-level assumptions (valuation profiles)
     - Asset Class level assumptions (valuation profile rules)
     - Asset Level assumptions (unit rates, indices, apportionment)
     - Component level assumptions (unit rates, useful life, residual value)

6. **Create Valuation Job**
   - **Role Responsible**: Valuer 游리
   - **Systems Used**: Asset Valuer Pro 游릭
   - **Inputs Required**: Valuation requirements, asset classes to be valued 游릭
   - **Outputs Produced**: Configured valuation job 游릭
   - **Decision Points**: 游리
     - Specifying asset classes to include
     - Setting effective date of valuation
     - Determining valuation parameters

7. **Import Initial Asset Register**
   - **Role Responsible**: Valuer/Data Specialist 游리
   - **Systems Used**: Asset Valuer Pro, Excel 游릭
   - **Inputs Required**: Client asset register data 游릭
   - **Outputs Produced**: Imported initial asset register in system 游릭
   - **Decision Points**: 游댮

     - Data cleansing approach
     - Handling import exceptions

### Process Outputs 游릭
- Configured client in Asset Valuer Pro
- Established user accounts with appropriate roles
- Defined asset hierarchy
- Configured valuation framework with assumptions
- Created valuation job ready for data collection

### Business Rules 游리
- Asset hierarchy must follow the specified structure (Class > Type > Sub-Type)
- Components must be specified with Type and Sub-Type
- Effective date of valuation is typically the first or last day of the financial year
- Initial asset register is usually imported from client's existing records
- Assumptions must be configured at multiple levels (entity, asset class, asset, component)

### Regulatory Requirements 游리
- Configuration must support compliance with accounting standards
- Framework must enable appropriate valuation approaches (market, income, cost)
- Structure must support required financial statement disclosures
