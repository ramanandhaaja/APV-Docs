# Business Documentation Update Summary
**Date:** April 30, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the updates made to the business process documentation following the April 24, 2025 meeting with Michelle Cross (APV Valuers & Asset Management). The meeting successfully addressed numerous information gaps previously marked in red in our documentation. Updated versions of the following documents have been created:

1. File_Setup_Process_Updated.md
2. Calculation_Reporting_Process_Updated.md
3. Post_Valuation_Process_Updated.md

## Key Information Gaps Addressed

### Priority Information Gaps Resolved

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Confirmed that metrics like job completion times are tracked externally, not within AVP
   - Used for internal reporting and quality management
   - Identified as a potential area for future system integration

2. **User Roles and Permissions**
   - Documented specific roles in the system and their permissions
   - Clarified that Sharon (administrator) handles client setup and job creation
   - Established that "support" login has highest level of access
   - Documented different access levels for valuers, clients, and auditors

3. **Manual Workarounds**
   - Documented extensive manual processes including:
     - Desktop land valuations requiring external spreadsheets
     - Report customization requiring Word editing
     - Manual percentage change checks for quality control
     - Manual asset creation for items not in initial register
     - Multiple Excel files for large dataset management

4. **Audit Support Procedures**
   - Documented process for providing auditors view-only access after verification
   - Clarified policies on limiting access to the valuation team
   - Documented that auditors may perform spot checks to verify calculations
   - Noted requirements for documentation of methodology

5. **Calculation Validation**
   - Documented system validation preventing finalization until errors are resolved
   - Added details about component values needing to sum to 100%
   - Described visual indicators for calculation status (valid, error, warning)

6. **Report Customization**
   - Documented current process using templates from AVP system
   - Clarified manual tailoring process in Word before PDF conversion
   - Noted desire for more built-in customization options in future iterations

7. **Archiving Policies**
   - Documented how archiving locks data while keeping it in database
   - Clarified that this ensures consistency across years
   - Noted timing (after financial statements are signed off)

8. **Asset Register Import Process**
   - Documented use of Excel for import and handling of large datasets
   - Added details about data cleansing and assumption application
   - Noted clarification of requirements in tenders

9. **Future Valuation Process**
   - Documented options to roll over previous valuations or start from scratch
   - Noted manual workarounds involved in rollover process

### Process-Specific Updates

#### File Setup Process
- Added administrator (Sharon) as specific process owner
- Documented user role hierarchy and permissions
- Detailed data import and validation process
- Added information about handling large datasets
- Documented external performance tracking

#### Calculation and Reporting Process
- Added detailed validation criteria and processes
- Documented report generation and customization workflow
- Added information about client access to reports
- Documented calculation refresh process and error handling
- Added details about manual quality control checks

#### Post-Valuation Process
- Documented audit access protocols and limitations
- Added information about archiving and data retention
- Detailed process for future valuation planning
- Added information about client system integration workflow
- Documented manual steps in the rollover process

## Remaining Information Gaps

Despite significant progress, several information gaps remain to be addressed:

1. **Common Challenges** (All processes)
   - What common issues are encountered during each process stage?
   - How are these issues typically resolved?

2. **Training and Knowledge Transfer**
   - How are users trained on system processes?
   - What documentation exists for training purposes?
   - How is knowledge transferred to new team members?

3. **Assumption Management**
   - What is the process for developing and validating assumptions?
   - How frequently are assumptions reviewed?

4. **Process Improvement Framework**
   - What formal process exists for continuous improvement?
   - How are improvement suggestions collected and evaluated?

5. **Technical Implementation Details**
   - How are business rules implemented in the codebase?
   - Where are calculation formulas documented? (Michelle to provide)

## Next Steps

1. Schedule follow-up meeting to address remaining information gaps
2. Review updated documentation with 62C for feedback
3. Arrange screen sharing session with Michelle's team to document user experience
4. Receive auditor's guide and methodology guide from Michelle (via SharePoint)
5. Obtain documentation of formulas used in valuation calculations
6. Finalize documentation updates based on all inputs

## Conclusion

The business process validation meeting has significantly improved our documentation by addressing 20+ information gaps previously marked in red. The updated documentation provides a much clearer picture of actual operational practices, including manual workarounds and external processes. This will help align technical documentation with real-world usage and provide 62C with a better understanding of the business processes supported by the software.

Several key gaps remain to be addressed in follow-up sessions, particularly around common challenges, training processes, and the formal process improvement framework. The planned screen sharing sessions will further enhance our understanding of the user experience and workflow details.
