### Step 1: Create ‘Valuation Framework’
The design of the ‘valuation framework’ is one of the most critical aspects of the valuation
process. However, once created, it only needs to be updated if new assets are to be valued
that do not fit the existing asset hierarchy or if you wish to change the underlying
assumptions.


The valuation framework includes:
- Asset Hierarchy
- Financial Reporting Hierarchy
- Valuation profiles
- Rules that determine which valuation profile to apply
- Various assumptions
