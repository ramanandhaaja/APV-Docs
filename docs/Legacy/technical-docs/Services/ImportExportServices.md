### üìù Business Context

#### üìã Critical Role in Valuation Workflow
According to the legacy documentation, import/export functionality is fundamental to the Asset Valuer Pro workflow:

> "An initial asset register and associated attributes are sourced from the client and imported into Asset Valuer Pro via Excel"

The ImportExportServices implement this core business requirement, enabling the data acquisition that begins the valuation process.

#### üìã Field Data Collection Process
The legacy documentation describes a specific workflow for field data collection:

> "All data held within Asset Valuer Pro is exported to CSV files and zip files (images) and imported into File Maker Pro running off the valuers PC. This is then synchronised to the iPad. On return to the office (or web access) the data is then synchronised back to the PC, exported and then imported back into Asset Valuer Pro."

The FieldDataImportService and export services implement this workflow, handling the transfer of data between the core system and mobile collection devices.

#### üìã Client Data Integration
For infrastructure assets, the documentation notes:

> "For infrastructure, the data is normally provided by the client in Excel files. The valuers will then clean up and sort the Excel files and import the data into Asset Valuer Pro."

The ImportExportServices include functionality specifically for handling and processing client-provided Excel files, with validation to ensure data quality.

#### üìã Format Support Requirements
The legacy documentation specifies format requirements:

> "All textual data can be imported and exported via Excel (version 2) or CSV file (version 3)... A separate process using zip files is used to import/export photos and images."

The services implement these exact format requirements, supporting both Excel and CSV for textual data and zip files for images.

### ‚ö° Performance Considerations
When working with large datasets:

1. **Batch Processing**
   - Process large imports in smaller batches
   - Use transactions for data integrity

2. **Memory Management**
   - Stream large files rather than loading entirely in memory
   - Release resources promptly after processing

3. **Parallel Processing**
   - Process multiple files concurrently where appropriate
   - Use background tasks for time-consuming operations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues and Solutions
‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** Watch for these common import/export challenges:

1. **Data Mapping Issues**
   - Field name mismatches
   - Solution: Use flexible mapping with alias support

2. **Character Encoding**
   - Special characters corrupted during transfer
   - Solution: Enforce UTF-8 encoding

3. **Image Handling**
   - Large images consuming excessive resources
   - Solution: Automatic resizing and compression

4. **Relationship Integrity**
   - References to non-existent entities
   - Solution: Validation before database modification

### üîß Integration Points
The ImportExportServices integrate with several other components:

- **File Storage**: Stores and retrieves import/export files
- **Validation Services**: Validates data against business rules
- **Logging Services**: Records import/export activities
- **Mobile App Interfaces**: Communicates with field collection apps
- **Authorization Services**: Controls access to import/export operations
