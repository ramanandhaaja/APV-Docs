# üìã Asset Valuer Pro Handoff Guide

## üìã Introduction

This document serves as an onboarding and handoff guide for developers, business analysts, and stakeholders who are new to the Asset Valuer Pro (AVP) system. It provides a structured approach to understanding the system's documentation, architecture, and key business processes.

## üìã Getting Started

### Documentation Overview

The AVP technical documentation is organized into several key areas:

1. **System Architecture**: Overall structure and components
2. **Business Technical Map**: Business processes mapped to technical components
3. **Component Documentation**: Detailed API, models, and service documentation
4. **Process Workflows**: End-to-end workflows for key business processes
5. **Data Dictionaries**: Field-level reference for core entities

Start by reviewing the [Documentation Index](Documentation_Index.md) for a complete map of available documentation.

### Environment Setup

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:**  
> The source code is maintained in a separate repository and is not synced to this documentation GitHub repository. You will need to request access to the source code repository separately.

For development environment setup:

1. Refer to the [Technology Stack](Technology_Stack.md) document for required tools and versions
2. The codebase is located in the `source-code` directory (note: this is separate from the documentation repository)
3. Main solution file: `AVP.sln` in the source-code directory
4. The system consists of several projects:
   - `API` - Web API and React frontend
   - `Application` - Business logic and application layer
   - `Domain` - Core domain models and business rules
   - `Infrastructure` - Data access and third-party integrations
   - `BackgroundTasks` - Background processing services

## üìã Understanding the System

### Core Business Context

Asset Valuer Pro is a specialized application for asset valuation that supports:

1. **Financial Reporting Valuation**: Fair value calculations for financial statements
2. **Insurance Valuation**: Replacement and indemnity value calculations
3. **Asset Management**: Lifecycle planning and condition assessment
4. **Field Data Collection**: Mobile data capture for physical attributes and condition

The system implements several valuation methodologies:
- Direct Cost
- Apportionment Cost
- Market Approach
- Income Approach

These align with accounting standards such as IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) and IPSAS (International Public Sector Accounting Standards).

### Key Technical Architecture

The system follows a clean architecture pattern with:

1. **Web Layer**: React frontend and ASP.NET Core API
2. **Application Layer**: CQRS pattern with MediatR for commands and queries
3. **Domain Layer**: Rich domain model with business logic
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Data access with Entity Framework Core

The application is deployed to Azure Cloud in the Sydney region with:
- Web application (.NET Core and React)
- iOS capture application
- Supporting infrastructure including logging and database systems
- Point-in-time recovery capability

### Version Considerations

The system exists in multiple versions:
- **Version 2**: Original implementation, using File Maker Pro for mobile data collection
- **Version 3**: Current implementation, with custom iOS app and enhanced features

Important differences are noted in the [Version Notes Guidelines](Version_Notes_Guidelines.md).

## üìã Key Business Processes

### Valuation Process

The end-to-end valuation process includes:

1. Client and Job setup
2. Valuation Framework creation (asset hierarchy and assumptions)
3. Asset Registration (import or manual)
4. Data Collection (field app or direct entry)
5. Calculation processing
6. Report generation
7. Job archiving

For detailed information, see the [Valuation Process Workflow](Workflows/Valuation_Process_Workflow.md).

### Field Data Collection

The field data collection process includes:

1. Exporting data to mobile app
2. Field inspection and data capture
3. Photograph collection
4. Data synchronization
5. Integration with valuation process

For detailed information, see the [Field Data Collection Workflow](Workflows/Field_Data_Collection_Workflow.md).

### Reporting

The reporting process includes:

1. Data validation
2. Report selection and configuration
3. Report generation
4. Export and storage

For detailed information, see the [Reporting Process Workflow](Workflows/Reporting_Process_Workflow.md).
