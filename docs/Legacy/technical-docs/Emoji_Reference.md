## How to Use Emojis in Documentation

1. **Section Headers**: Place the appropriate emoji at the beginning of section headers
   ```markdown
   ## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
   ```

2. **Information Notes**: Use emojis for callout information
   ```markdown
   💡 **Tip:** Use pagination for large datasets to improve performance.
   ```

3. **API Endpoints**: Mark HTTP methods with the appropriate emoji
   ```markdown

   ```

## Consistency Guidelines

1. Use emojis sparingly and purposefully - only where they add value
2. Place emojis at the beginning of headers or key points, not in the middle of text
3. Maintain consistency across all documentation
4. Limit to 1-2 emojis per section to avoid visual clutter
