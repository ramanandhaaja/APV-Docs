## üèóÔ∏è DETAILED DOCUMENTATION

### üèóÔ∏è Overview
The HierarchyNode model is a cornerstone of Asset Valuer Pro's classification system, providing a flexible, recursive hierarchical structure for organizing assets and components. It implements a "composite pattern" that allows for the creation of complex hierarchies while maintaining consistency in structure. The model is used to represent both asset classification hierarchies (AssetClass ‚Üí AssetType ‚Üí AssetSubType) and component classification hierarchies (ComponentName ‚Üí ComponentType ‚Üí ComponentSubType).

| `SortOrder` | int | Position for display ordering |

#### Additional Fields
| Property | Type | Description |

### üèóÔ∏è Navigation Properties
- `Parent`: Reference to the parent HierarchyNode
- `Children`: Collection of child HierarchyNodes

### üìù Business Context

The HierarchyNode model directly implements the hierarchical structure described in the legacy documentation:

> "The asset hierarchy is an essential element. It requires all assets to be described based on - Asset Class, Asset Type, Asset Sub-Type. Based on that combination we specify what the 'components' will be and for each 'component' to specify the - Component Type, Component Sub-Type."

This multilevel hierarchy is crucial for the valuation framework, as it determines how assumptions and valuation profiles are applied:

> "The types of assumptions include - Entity level assumptions (valuation profiles), Asset Class level assumptions (valuation profile rules), Asset Level assumptions (asset level unit rates, indices, apportionment), Component level assumptions (component level unit rates, short-life and long-life splits, useful life, residual value)"

The hierarchy determines which assumptions apply to each asset and component.

### üèóÔ∏è Hierarchy Types

The HierarchyNode model supports different types of hierarchies through the HierarchyType property:

#### Asset Hierarchy
1. **AssetClass** (Level 0): Top-level classification (e.g., Buildings, Infrastructure)
2. **AssetType** (Level 1): Sub-classification within a class (e.g., Commercial Buildings, Residential Buildings)
3. **AssetSubType** (Level 2): Detailed classification (e.g., Office Buildings, Retail Buildings)

#### Component Hierarchy
1. **ComponentName** (Level 0): Top-level component category (e.g., Structure, Roof, Services)
2. **ComponentType** (Level 1): Sub-category of component (e.g., Metal Roof, Tiled Roof)
3. **ComponentSubType** (Level 2): Detailed component type (e.g., Colorbond, Zincalume)

### üèóÔ∏è Usage in Valuation Process

The HierarchyNode model plays a critical role in the "Create the Valuation Framework" step of the valuation process:

> "Create the 'Valuation Framework' (this includes an Asset Hierarchy and relevant assumptions)"

This framework is essential for appropriate valuation calculations, as it determines:
1. Which components are expected for each asset type
2. Which valuation profiles apply to different assets and components
3. How unit rates and other assumptions are applied

### üèóÔ∏è Implementation Details

The HierarchyNode is implemented using a recursive self-referencing structure:

1. **Parent-Child Relationships**:
   - Each node (except root nodes) has a parent reference
   - Each node can have multiple children
   - The Level property indicates the depth in the hierarchy

2. **Hierarchy Traversal**:
   - The model includes methods for traversing up and down the hierarchy
   - `GetAncestors()` retrieves all parent nodes up to the root
   - `GetDescendants()` retrieves all child nodes recursively
   - `GetRootNode()` finds the topmost parent
   - `GetSiblings()` finds nodes at the same level with the same parent

3. **Hierarchy Validation**:
   - Ensures consistent typing (e.g., AssetClass can only have AssetType children)
   - Validates level values match the actual position in the hierarchy
   - Prevents circular references
   - Enforces unique codes within the same parent

### üèóÔ∏è Management Operations

The following operations are supported for hierarchy management:

1. **Create Node**:
   - Adds a new node to the hierarchy
   - Automatically sets the Level based on parent
   - Validates hierarchy type consistency

2. **Move Node**:
   - Relocates a node and its descendants to a new parent
   - Updates Level values for all affected nodes
   - Preserves relationships between moved nodes

3. **Copy Node**:
   - Creates a copy of a node and its descendants
   - Generates new IDs for all copied nodes
   - Preserves the structure and relationships

4. **Deactivate Node**:
   - Marks a node as inactive rather than deleting it
   - Preserves historical data while hiding the node from active use
   - Can be reactivated if needed

### ‚ö° Performance Considerations

Due to the hierarchical nature and extensive use of this model:

1. **Efficient Querying**:
   - Indexed fields include ParentId, HierarchyType, and Level for efficient querying
   - Specialized queries for common hierarchy operations
   - Hierarchy paths are sometimes denormalized for faster traversal

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Hierarchies change infrequently and are accessed often, making them ideal for caching
   - In-memory representation for faster traversal
   - Cache invalidation on hierarchy modifications

3. **Bulk Operations**:
   - Specialized handling for bulk import and export of hierarchies
   - Batch processing for multiple node operations
