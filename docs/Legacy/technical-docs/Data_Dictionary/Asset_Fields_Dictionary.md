   - Asset must have valid AssetClass, AssetType, and AssetSubType
   - ValuationType must be appropriate for the asset class

3. **Valuation Readiness Rules**
   ```csharp
   // Asset is ready for valuation when:
   AssetClassId is not null && 
   ValuationPolicy != ValuationPolicies.Undefined &&
   ValuationPolicy != ValuationPolicies.NotToBeValued && 
   IsControlledForFinancialPurpose &&
   AssetClass?.Job is not null && 
   AssetAssumptions is not null &&
   (DecommissionDate is null || DecommissionDate > AssetClass.Job.EffectiveDateOfValuation)
   ```

4. **Specialized Method Rules**
   - Market approach valuation requires MarketApproach object
   - Income approach valuation requires IncomeApproach object

## ðŸ“‹ Business Impact and Usage

### Financial Reporting
Assets provide the foundation for financial reporting valuation, with their classification, status, and attributes directly impacting:
- Gross replacement cost calculations
- Current value (fair value) determination
- Depreciation expense calculations
- Financial statement disclosures

### Asset Management
Asset data supports asset management through:
- Condition assessment (Status field)
- Location tracking (Address, Facility fields)
- Lifespan management (AcquisitionDate, DecommissionDate)
- Maintenance planning (MaintenancePlans collection)

### Insurance Valuation

- Replacement cost determination
- Escalation factors
- Professional fees calculations
- Debris removal estimates

## ðŸ“‹ Data Collection Methods

Asset data is collected through multiple channels:
1. **Direct Entry**: Web interface manual entry
2. **Bulk Import**: CSV/Excel import of asset registers
3. **Field Data Collection**: Mobile app capture of physical attributes and condition
4. **System Calculation**: Valuation results generated by system

## ðŸ“‹ Version Considerations

### Version 2 vs. Version 3 Differences
- Version 3 adds more comprehensive GPS location support
- Version 3 enhances CustomFields capabilities
- Version 3 improves validation with structured Errors and Warnings collections
- Version 3 adds more comprehensive MaintenancePlans tracking
