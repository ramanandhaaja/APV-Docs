# AVP Codebase Overview

Welcome to the AVP (Audio-Visual Platform) codebase documentation. This documentation serves as the central hub for understanding the architecture, components, and implementation details of the AVP ecosystem, which consists of three main components:

1. **Web Application** - The responsive frontend interface built with modern web technologies
2. **Mobile Application** - Native mobile experience for iOS and Android platforms
3. **Web API** - The backend service layer that powers both web and mobile applications

## Codebase Architecture

The AVP platform follows a modular and scalable architecture designed to support multiple client applications while maintaining a consistent backend service layer. The system is built with performance, security, and maintainability as primary considerations.

### Key Components

#### 1. Web Application
- Built with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for a responsive user interface
- State management using Redux for predictable state container
- Modern UI components with Material-UI framework
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet experiences

#### 2. Mobile Application
- Cross-platform development using React Native
- Native performance with platform-specific optimizations
- Offline-first architecture for better user experience
- Seamless integration with device features (camera, GPS, etc.)

#### 3. Web API
- RESTful API built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- Authentication and authorization using JWT
- Database interactions with PostgreSQL
- Caching layer with Redis for improved performance
- Comprehensive API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
